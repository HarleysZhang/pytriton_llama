            The 'unsqueeze_dim' argument specifies the dimension along which to unsqueeze cos[position_ids] and
            sin[position_ids] so that they can be properly broadcasted to the dimensions of q and k. For example, note
            that cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] have the shape [batch_size, seq_len, head_dim]. Then, if q and
            k have the shape [batch_size, heads, seq_len, head_dim], then setting unsqueeze_dim=1 makes
            cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] broadcastable to the shapes of q and k. Similarly, if q and k have
